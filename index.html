                Art Historians use tapestries and paintings to decipher how wars were fought in different time periods. With this collection, we can go deeper into War Art and observe changes in how artists and photographers chose to depict battles and massacres based on the cultural norms at the time. How they used art to convince both their own populations that it was a noble fight and the enemy that they would win.

                <br><br><i>Why?</i><br><br>
                I chose to embark on this intellectual challenge as I want to broaden my knowledge of art. I haven’t ever really considered the finer details of art and, with all the news and images of war in Ukraine at the moment, I thought it would be interesting to see how others used to show and see conflict. I wanted to challenge myself and learn something new during this process.<br>

            <p>Artist:                     <em>Unknown, Flemish</em><br><br>
                Date:                      <em>After 1525</em><br><br>
                Method:                  <em>Painting, oil-on-panel</em><br><br>
                Movement of Art:    <em>Mannerism</em><br><br>
                Painting Summary:<br>
                <i>This painting commemorates the 24 February 1525 military engagement between the armies of the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V, and the King of France, Francis I. The Battle of Pavia represented one of many between 1521 and 1529 that sought to resolve the issue of control over the Lombardy region in northern Italy, a strategic communication point between Spain, Germany, and the Netherlands. The imperial army is depicted at the lower left; the soon-to-be defeated French are identified by their flag, white lilies on a blue field.</i>

                        <i>“This first piece for my collection embodies themes like large panoramas, rich representation of different parties, and descriptive backgrounds. The themes of this period are accentuated by the numerous, and wide-scale mini aggressions that collate into one splash of rich, accentuated colour.”</i>

            <img src="The storming of the fortress of Stampace in Pisa - Giorgio Vasari.jpg" height="375px">
            <p>Artist:                     <em>Giorgio Vasari</em><br><br>
                Date:                      <em>1568-1571</em><br><br>
                Method:                  <em>Fresco, painting</em><br><br>
                Movement of Art:    <em>Mannerism</em><br><br>
                Painting Notes:<br>
                <em>In 1499 the Rock of Stampace was captured by the Florentines. This fresco depicts the battle between the resident Picarians and the invading Florentines. The artwork is full of precise detail since Battista Naldini, Giorgio Vasari’s assistant had been sent to the site of the battle to draw a series of sketches and views.</em>
                <br><br>
                Curator's Note:<br>
                <i>“This Italian fresco wall painting, which currently resides in the Palazzo Vecchio Museum, Comune di Firenze, depicts an epic battle in which the Florentines were able to take the Rock of Stampace. At this period, art depicting war is very vivid and full of detail and colour. The depicted characters are mostly unclothed showing the lack of armour in this period. The scene is most likely glorified as the victors painted the fresco, as the perspective is skewed on an angle, and the horses’ hindquarters look larger than in real life.”</i>

            <p>Artist:                    <em>Juan de la Corte</em><br><br>
                Date:                     <em>1630-1660</em><br><br>
                Method:                 <em>Painting, oil-on-canvas</em><br><br>
                Movement of Art:   <em>Baroque</em><br><br>
                Painting Notes:<br>
                <i>This scene of combat can be identified among the numerous narratives of this type to be found in the Bible from the presence of an imploring woman among the soldiers. The prophetess Deborah summoned the warrior Barak so that he could engage in combat with Jabin, King of Canaan, whose troops were commanded by Sisera. As is habitual in the work of this artist, the depiction is not exactly faithful to the biblical text and includes, for example, soldiers in boats located in an imaginary setting and a city with a port, towers, walls and buildings located high up in the pictorial space and similar to the cities in other works at this time.</i>
                <br><br>Curator’s Notes:<br>
                <i>“Moving north to the Spanish, this painting – although it depicts a scene from the Bible – is still an integral piece as it gives us greater understanding on what the artists and noble courts depicted war as, not just physically manifested battles. This specimen in our collection draws on similar techniques utilised by Vasari such as light brown tones, and still this underlying theme of wide panoramas with detailed massed of forces battling victoriously and displaying evident pride while holding standards.</i><br>
                <i>May I for one moment draw your attention to the character facing towards the sky with their arms open? This is a prime example of the holy aspect of medieval warfare, how there would be blessings to higher beings, and they regarded the quality of their sacrifice as testament to whether they would 	defeat the enemy.”</i>

            <p>Artist(s):                <em>Jan Styka, Wojciech Kossak</em><br><br>
                Date:                   <em>1839-1894</em><br><br>
                Method:                <em>Cyclorama, oil-on-canvas</em><br><br>
                Movement of Art: <em>Panorama, 19th century</em><br><br>
                Painting Notes: <br><i>The Raclawice Panorama is a 15x114 metre cycloramic painting depicting The Battle of Raclawice. The painting is one of only a few preserved representations of a genre of 19th-century mass pop-culture, and the oldest in Poland. The project was initiated as a patriotic commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the Battle of Raclawice, and it was first shown at the General National Exhibition in Lviv (Ukraine) in 1894. Due to its delicate nature; both physical and symbolical, the panorama was transferred into hiding in Wroclaw, Poland during WWII where it stands today in a custom building.
                    </i><br><br>
                    Curator's Notes: <br>
                        <i>“This is the only painting in this curation that I have experienced first-hand. I saw this in Poland at the Panorama Museum, where it lies today. It is an artistic phenomenon and takes your breath away from realising that it only took nine months to fashion. Modern advancements of lighting and presentation have improved its appearance; and the addition of physical artificial turf; and some decorative pieces (see annotated image below) give the cyclorama a sense of depth and distance. The artistic perspectives to this piece do differ from the previous pieces – for example, key figures are highlighted and more descriptive, while keeping a very solid sense of depth and distance. The colours are notably blander, and monotone compared to the previous rich hues of brown and orange.”</i>
